title: Code Poetry in Clojure

What follows is my winning entry to the
[Vienna Code Poetry Slam 2016](https://www.codepoetry.at/eng#einreichungen-2016-section).
It is an executable [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) program.
To read the poem, drop all special characters but keep the spaces.
So for example

`:life is (not :a))} :s))})))print)`

becomes

`life is not a sprint`

And here is the poem:

---------------------------------

    (def is "death") (

    def is true) (
    def was #(not (= % false))) (
    def said "you") (

    while (some was said) (
    and "nothing" was :done) (
    some #{said} ["you"
    "are the chosen" "one"]) ({

    :to :die :in :this} :world) (-> (
    :to (:die :al(:one {
    :to :die :forsaken
    :as :the :only :one (

    let [him "finish" his "job"] ({
    :you :can't :interfere
    "your job i":s {:to "keep going\n"}
    :and "wait" :for him :here

    "he" :will (take his) :time (
    and "so should you"
    :life is (not :a))} :s))})))print)
    "remember that too")
